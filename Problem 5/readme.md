# Problem 2.5
Given 4 floating-point numbers. Use a string formatting expression with conversion specifiers to output their product and their average as integers (rounded), then as floating-point numbers.

Output each rounded integer using the following:
print(f'{your_value:.0f}')

Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.3f}')

Ex: If the input is:

    8.3
    10.4
    5.0
    4.8

the output is:

    2072 7
    2071.680 7.125
